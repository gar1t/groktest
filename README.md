# Groktest

Groktest is a test framework that's inspired by Python's long standing
[`doctest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) library.

Similarities to `doctest`:

- A test suite is a plain text file containing more or more tests
- A test is an *expression* accompanied by an *expected result*
- A test is run by evaluating the expression in the applicable
  language environment to generate a *computed result*
- A test passes when its *computed result* matches is *expected result*
  and fails otherwise

Differences to `doctest`:

- Test expressions may be defined in any supported language (currently
  Python, bash planned, support for other languages over time)
- Expected results may contain format-expressions, which are used to
  match expected output to a pattern with optional value capture to
  runtime state variables (see examples below)
- Tests are not sensitive to white-space by default
- Test options do not require a `doctest:` prefix
- Front-matter in test files may be used to configure a test suite

### Why?

Python's `doctest` paved the way for computational documents like
Jupyter Notebooks, R Markdown, and Quarto. It was one of the first of
its kind. We owe a debt of grattutude to Tim Peters for the original
work and to Jim Fulton for advancing its use.

The rationale for `doctest` is that examples provide a high-signal,
low-noise representation of developer intent.

- Tests are framed within comments (rather than using comments), which
  encourages a narrative mode of testing
- Examples are often easier to understand (grok) than a series of
  assertions
- Example output can replace a large number of explicit assertions,
  providing more test coverage with fewer expresions

`doctest` however presents some key problems.

- Result comparison can use an ellipsis `...` to match any output; while
  the match is geedy, it can match invalid output and mast errors
- The framework is Python specific and difficult to apply to cases
  outside Python
- Pattern matching is limited to a single 'match all' pattern
- Output from tests cannot be captured for use in subsequent tests

Groktest addresses these issues while maintaining the original `doctest`
value proposition.

### Not supported in Groktest

Groktest is in its early development phases. Its immediate goal is to be
a near drop-in replacement for `doctest` for tests defined in standalone
plain text files.

Groktest is not designed to test Python doc strings. Use `doctest` for
that.

While Groktest is designed to be language independent, it will take some
time to get this right. In order of priority, Groktest will support:

1. Tests defined using Python expressions (under development)
2. Tests defined as shell commands with bash/sh as the first target (planned)
3. Other runtimes as the project evolves (e.g R, Node, Julia, Erlang,
   etc.)

## Examples

The simplest example is an exact match.

    >>> 'The number 42 is overused in examples'
    'The number 42 is overused in examples'

In `groktest` you can provide a *format expression*, which has the
format `{[name][:format]}`. The following example asserts that the claim
contains a series of digits.

    >>> 'The number 42 is overused in examples'  # doctest: +SKIP
    'The number {:d} is overused in examples'

Matched values can be bound to local variables.

    >>> 'The number 42 is overused in examples'  # doctest: +SKIP
    'The number {n} is overused in examples'

    >>> n == 42  # doctest: +SKIP
    True

Output parsing is provided by Richard Jones' outstanding
[`parse`](https://github.com/r1chardj0n3s/parse) library.

To match anything, use `{}`.

    >>> 'Another tedious example is the use of "ham" and "spam"'
    ... # doctest: +SKIP
    'Another tedious example is {}'

Multiline expressions are continued on subsequent lines using `...`.

    >>> (1 +
    ... 2 + 4)
    7

Front matter is used to configure tests.

    ---
    test-config:
      ps1: '> '
      ps2: '+ '
    ---

    > "This should be familiar
    + to R developers"

Aside: In this case the use of `>` conflicts with Markdown's syntax for
block quotes. We recommend indenting tests with four spaces in Markdown
files.

Custom format types may be defined in test font matter.

    ---
    test-config:
      match-types:
        id: [a-f0-9]{8}
    ---

    >>> 'Sample id is abcd1234'  # doctest: +SKIP
    Sample id is {:id}

## What works?

A this point Groktest is in early development and nothing much of use is
available.

Refer to Groktest tests to see what works. Run them to verify!

Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to contribute to this
project. While we don't have a contribution policy we will get there! In
the meantime, use the following guidelines:

1. Use the [project issue
   tracker](https://github.com/gar1t/groktest/issues) to ask questions,
   report bugs, and suggest features.

2. Contributions will be accepted via pull requests.

3. All tests in [`tests.md`](tests.md) should pass.

4. All source code is formatted using `black` - expect any contribution
   to be reformatted on this basis.

5. Before working on a contribution, we recommend opening an issue to
   get early feedback.

6. We expect contributors to follow generally accepted standards of
   respect and kindness to others.
