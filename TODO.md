  - Generalize (e.g. reporter/callback facility)
  - Modernize Grokville reports

- Test result refactor
  - Test results as dict is lame - we should type this
  - Should know about skipped tests

- Final tests results should report
  - Total number of tests
  - Tests passed
  - Tests failed
  - Tests skipped
